IO Connections on the PacSat AFSK processor
===========================================

These are the pins on the TMS570 processor, where they go, what they
do and some notes at the end with some more details.

The "G" column shows the GPIO usage and capability.  The first letter
is how the GPIO is used: I for input, O for output, B for
bidirectional, blank if not used as a GPIO, and ? if the function is
not known (the PC104 pins).  The second letter is U for pullup by
default and D for pulldown by default or blank if the pin cannot be
used as a GPIO.

\*Notes below

Interrupts and GPIOs
--------------------

On the TMS570, most normal pins can also be used at GPIOs, but they
are not capable of generating interrupts.  Only the GIOx[n] pins can
generate interrupts, and they are all used for that purpose.


Notes on thermsistors
---------------------

Thermsistors are connected to ADC pins on the processor to measure
temperatures on the board.  Resistance varies from 534 ohms (125C) to
188.5K (-40C).  There is a 10K bias, so this gives this gives a .17V
(125C) to 3.13V (-40C) voltage range.  It is supposed to be fairly
linear.

Notes on Processor\_Reset
------------------------

The 3.3V and 1.2V power converts have power good output pins, and the
1.2V current limiter has a power good pin, all open collector.  These
are wire-or-ed to the processor reset pin.  When any of them senses
there is a power issue, they will pull the reset pin.  After the 1.2V
current limiter turns on (which takes a little bit of time, it is
inrush limited) it will wait 50us and before releasing the reset pin,
so reset should happen automatically on any power up or power problem.

Notes on FEED\_WATCHDOG
-----------------------

This must be toggled at least once a second.  If it isn't, the
hardware watchdog will power off the board for 200ms and power it back
on.

Notes on TX Power Measurement
-----------------------------

A directional coupler and power measurement chips (ADL5501AK) feed
into the ADCs (Forward power to pin 74 AD1IN[3] and reverse to pin 73
AS1IN[2]) and an enable for those parts into pin 124 N2HET1[12].  Pin
124 is pulled down by default, so the chips will be disabled at reset.
The direction coupler is 4mm long with .1524mm traces .127mm apart.
At full power out (+33dBm) this will result in about -7dBm of power
from the coupler.  This was simulated with a transmission line in
qucs.  The voltage for that can be calculated from the chip manual.

FIXME - Figure out what all the PC104 pins do.

# PC104 Pins

  - HW\_POWER\_OFF[12]\_N - Input to board, pulling this low causes the
    power to be disabled on boardn.  boardn pulls this high with a 10K
	resistor.  If driven, it should be open drain or open collector.
	Be careful not to glitch this line.

  - PRESENCE[12]\_N - The board is physically present.  This must be
	pulled high by a 1M resistor on entity reading this value, it is
	pulled low by a 10K resistor on boardn.
	
  - ACTIVE[12]\_N - boardn is asserting that it is active.  This is
	pulled high on boardn and will be driven low by boardn when it is
	active and not under external active/standby control.  When under
	external active/standby control, this is an input that another
	entity must pull low to cause the board to go active.
	
  - FAULT[12]\_N - Output from boardn, the processor is reporting an error.

  - UMBILICAL\_ATTACHED - Input to the board, if high the satellite is in
    the launch vehicle.  This inhibits transmit in hardware and causes
	the software to behave differently.  If this line is not used make
	sure to populate the resistor pulling it down.
	
  - SAFE\_MODE\_N - Connected to the processor so a controlling system
    can tell it to go into a safe mode.  What it does depends on context.

  - 5V_p - +5V that is always present when the satellite is powered.
    The board has a 0 ohm resistor that must be populated to get power
	from these pins.
  
  - 3V3_p - +3.3V that is always present when the satellite is powered.
    The board has a 0 ohm resistor that must be populated to get power
	from these pins.
  
  - 5V_S[1-3] - Switched +5V power from the power supply.  The board
    has 0 ohm resistors, one of which must be populated to get power
    from these pins.
  
  - 3V3_S[1-3] - Switched +3.3V power from the power supply.    The
	board has a 0 ohm resistor that must be populated to get power
	from these pins.

  - I2C\_SDA, I2C\_SCL - I2C bus pins

  - GND
  
  - CAN[AB][+-] - CAN bus signals.
  
# Active/Standby Configuration

The boards supports having a mate board that is the same board with
one resistor difference to differentiate between board 1 and board 2.
The BOARD\_NUM line is used to tell which board you are.  This also
selects values coming from the PC104.  The "other" board is the board
you are not.  The lines on the PC104 are:

- PRESENCEn\_N - This is used to tell if the other board is present
  (even if it is powered down).  It will be high if not present and
  low if present.
  
- FAULTn\_N - This is used to tell if the other board has had a fault
  and is failing.  This board can take over processing at that point.
  
- ACTIVEn\_N - Used to tell which board is active.  The board that is
  asserting its line thinks it is active.  If both boards assert this,
  board 1 will be active and board 2 must deactivate.
  
- HW\_POWER\_OFFn\_N - Used to power the other board off.  It this
  board thinks the other board is misbehaving, it can power off the
  other board.

The lines from the other board become OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N,
OTHER\_FAULT\_N, OTHER\_ACTIVE\_N, and OTHER\_HW\_POWER\_OFF\_N on a
board.  The lines for this board become PRESENCE\_N, FAULT\_N,
ACTIVE\_N, and HW\_POWER\_OFF\_N.

The active board may also be externally controlled.  If the
EXTERN\_CONTROL line is pulled high, the board will assume that some
other external entity will choose which board is active.  In this
case, the ACTIVE\_N line becomes an input and the processor monitors
that line to know if it should be active or not.

The ACTIVE1\_N line also controls several RF switches on board 1.
There is a second set of SMA connectors that connect from board 1 to
board 2 to carry the RF to board 2.  If board 1 is active, the RF is
switched to board 1 and the RF to/from board 2 is shunted to a 50 ohm
resistor between transmit and receive.  Likewise, when board 1 is
inactive, it connects the RF to the board 2 connectors and shunts the
board 1 RF between transmit and receive through a 50 ohm resistor.
(For the reason for this shunt, see the section on RF Loopback Test)

On board 2, the RF switches are not populated and the RF goes through
a zero ohm resistor to connect it, bypassing the switch connections.
On board 1 these resistors must not be populated.  If the board is
configured for simplex, then the RF switches are also not connected
and the zero ohm resistors are populated.

It is also possible to have separate antennas for each board.  Then
the RF switches and second set of SMAs are not relevant and can be
removed or just set up for loopback testing.

All the board switch circuitry is powered with +5V so it works even if
the board is powered down.  Care must be taken to not drive any I/O
lines with +5V; voltage dividers are present in several places to
bring +5V down to +2.5V for pull ups.

See the end of this document for the active/standby state machine.

MRAM data is automatically synced to the other board via the CAN bus.
The inactive side has the MRAM unmounted and is only syncing data.
The sync protocol is reliable and the remote end must respond that it
has written the data before the local end commits the write.  When a
board activates, it mounts MRAM and continues operation.  Applications
can either store all state data in MRAM or they can implement their
own synchronization protocol.

When the other board is down and then comes up, it will request a full
sync and all data will be transferred.  On a requested activity
switch, special handling is done to keep both sides in sync so the
newly inactive side can simply start receiving updates and a full sync
is not required.

If the inactive board detects a sync error, it will request a full
sync.

The inactive board will have all RF powered down and will do minimal
processing to avoid using very much power.  Basically just handling
synchronization data.

# RF Loopback Test

When in standby mode, the inactive board will have the RF output of
the transmitter tied in to the RF input of the receiver through a 50
ohm resistor.  At 440MHz, the input impedance of the first receive
filter is very low and its gain at 440MHz is <-100dB.  So it should
be safe for both the transmitter and receiver if the transmitter
transmits at 440MHz at full power.

If the transmitter transmits at 144.5MHz, the calculated loss in all
the filters is around -75dB.  There is 20dB of gain in the PA, and the
AX5043 can send at 16dBm.  Adding all that up, you get -39dBm coming
out of the transmitter.  If that is sent through the 50 ohm resistor,
there will be some more loss there, but you should get a signal well
within readable range for the receive AX5043s.  And though the
mismatch will be bad for the transmitter, the power is low enough to
not harm the PA.  So this can be used as a self test of the
transmitter and receiver while the board is in inactive mode.  If the
signal too hot, the transmit AX5043 can reduce output power.

If populated with the proper RF switches (the ones hooked to
BOARD1\_RF\_IN\_BYPASS), this could be done on a simplex board, too.
It can just deactivate its ACTIVE\_N line and the RF switch will go to
the bypass.

I am unsure if the TX AX5043 can be coerced into being able to
transmit at both 144MHz and 440MHz.

# Power Control and Sequencing

The power control on the board is fairly simple.  On power up, power
comes in through VSYS, goes through and inductor, and goes to +5V,
which is always powered on.  +5V goes through a current limiter to
+5VAL, which power the circuits on the board that are always on, the
circuits the handle the board presence/active/etc. and the board1 RF
switches, and the CAN bus transceivers.  3.3V comes in to REG\_3V3
from the bus.

The TPSM828302ARDSR will start supplying 1.2V to REG\_1V2.  It will
also pull the PROCESSOR\_RESET pin low until their power is good, and
that point they will not pull the reset line low any more (they are
open drain).  At that point the MP5073GG-P is also holding reset line
low until it is enabled.  Since the MP5073GG-P is powered by REG\_3V3
it will not let the reset line go until that power is good.

The STWD100NYWY3F hardware watchdog will power up at that time, but
the POWER\_ENABLE pin from it will be pulled high and should remain
high for 1 second.

The MP5073GG-P and MAX4495AAUT current limiting chips will start
supplying power to the rest of the board once they detect that power
is good.  However, the MP5073GG-P will wait 50us after it senses the
1.2V power is good holding the PROCESSOR\_RESET line low, then it will
let the processor go.

All the chips driving the PROCESSOR\_RESET line have power sensors, if
any of them sense that the power is bad they will pull that line down
low.

When the processor is in reset and the default settings on the
PA\_PWR\_EN, AX5043\_PWR\_EN, and LNA\_ENABLE are pulled low (and
they have pull downs, too, so that they are disabled even when the
main power is disabled), so all power to the RF elements will be
off.

A HW\_POWER\_OFF\_N comes in from the PC104 connector; if that is
pulled low it will power off everything on the board except for the
devices on +5VAL.  It does this by disabling the 3.3V and 1.2V
regulators.  When 3.3V is off, the MAX4995s controlling power to the
PA, AX5043s, and LNA will be powered off.

There is also a hardware watchdog, as mentioned before.  The processor
must toggle the FEED\_WATCHDOG line at least once a second.  If it
fails to do that, the 1.2V and 3.3V current limiters will be disabled
cutting power to the processor and all digital components.  This will
result in everything else being powered off (except the devices on
+5VAL).  After 200ms, the watchdog chip will enable power again.

To power up and enable the RF section, the processor must first make
sure all the AX5043 enable lines are pulled high to disable them.
This is not the default (some are low and some are high by default),
but it doesn't matter because they are powered off at the main,
anyway.  The processor then can drive AX5043\_PWR\_EN high to enable
the power to all AX5043s.  The processor can then drive the individual
AX5043 enables low to individually power them on.  Then the processor
can drive PA\_PWR\_EN high to power on the PA and LNA\_ENABLE high
to power on the LNA.

# Board Configuration

The board has a number of zero-ohm resistors for configuring the
board.  These are:

  - 1.2V\_INPUT - Determines whether 1.2V is derived from 3.3V or 5V.

  - BOARD\_NUM - Remove for board 1 or simplex, populate for board 2.

  - EXTERN\_CONTROL - Remove if the board (or board pair) manage their
    own activity and power state.  Populate if another entity controls
    power and the active lines on a board pair.  This should generally
    not be populated on a simplex board, it will always be active and
    some other entity probably controls its power signal.
	
  - 5V\_S[1-3], 5V\_p - One of these should be populated depending on
    where the board should get its +5V power.

  - 3V3\_S[1-3], 3V3\_p - One of these should be populated depending on
    where the board should get its +3.3V power.

# Active/Standby State Machine

The logic below is for the board being active or not.  For instance,
if OTHER\_FAULT\_N is low, then it is true.  These are all this way
since they are all negative logic.  This is only used if the active
state is not externally controlled.

The boards will switch activity periodically to test the other board.

  - PowerUp:

    - !OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N -> ActiveOtherBoardNotPresent
    - OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N && OTHER\_ACTIVE\_N -> Inactive
    - OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N && !OTHER\_ACTIVE\_N && !IAmBoard2 -> ActiveOtherBoardPresent
    - OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N && !OTHER\_ACTIVE\_N && IAmBoard2 -> InactiveWaitActivate
      - start timer

  - Inactive:
    - OTHER\_FAULT\_N -> ActiveOtherBoardPresent
      - power cycle other board.
    - !OTHER\_ACTIVE\_N -> ActiveOtherBoardPresent
    - !OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N -> ActiveOtherBoardNotPresent
      - log presence issue

  - InactiveWaitActivate:
    - OTHER\_FAULT\_N -> ActiveOtherBoardPresent
      - stop timer
      - power cycle other board.
    - OTHER\_ACTIVE\_N -> Inactive
      - stop timer
    - !OTHER\_ACTIVE\_N && timeout -> ActiveOtherBoardPresent
    - !OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N -> ActiveOtherBoardNotPresent
      - stop timer
      - log presence issue

  - ActiveOtherBoardPresent:
    - OTHER\_FAULT\_N -> ActiveOtherBoardPresent
      - power cycle other board.
    - OTHER\_ACTIVE\_N -> Inactive
    - !OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N -> ActiveOtherBoardNotPresent
      - log presence issue
  
  - ActiveOtherBoardNotPresent:
    - OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N -> ActiveOtherBoardPresent
      - log presence issue

Note that except for power up, transitions based on OTHER\_PRESENCE\_N
should never happen.  These should be logged.

FIXME - There needs to be some synchronization handling added to this.

FIXME - Some sort of handling needs to be added in the case that the
other board is determined to be faulty.

FIXME - May need to debounce some of these lines.

FIXME - For a controlled activity switch, it probably needs to be
handled by messaging and the hardware lines are used to do the final
switch.
